# ðŸš€ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Setup (Automated)

**Option 1: Use the automated setup script**
1. Create the repository `CampusConnect-demo` on GitHub.com (see Step 1 below)
2. Run: `setup-github.bat`
3. Enter your GitHub username when prompted
4. Done! âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Setup (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill out the repository details:**
   - Repository name: `CampusConnect-demo`
   - Description: `A comprehensive campus management application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase`
   - Set to **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository (Choose One Method)

**Method A: Automated Setup**
```bash
# Run the setup script and enter your GitHub username
setup-github.bat
```

**Method B: Manual Setup**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your project directory:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CampusConnect-demo.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

### Step 3: Verify Setup

After pushing, you should see your code on GitHub at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CampusConnect-demo`

## âœ… One-Click Checkpoint System is Ready!

Now you can use the checkpoint system:

### Create Checkpoints
```bash
checkpoint.bat create "Added new feature"
checkpoint.bat create "Fixed bug in authentication"
checkpoint.bat create "Updated dashboard design"
```

### List Checkpoints
```bash
checkpoint.bat list
```

### Restore to Previous Checkpoint
```bash
checkpoint.bat restore
# Enter the checkpoint ID when prompted
```

### Push to GitHub
```bash
checkpoint.bat push
```

## ðŸ”§ Quick Commands Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `checkpoint.bat create "message"` | Save current state with a message |
| `checkpoint.bat list` | Show recent checkpoints |
| `checkpoint.bat restore` | Go back to a previous checkpoint |
| `checkpoint.bat push` | Upload to GitHub |

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Work on a feature
# ... make changes to your code ...

# 2. Create a checkpoint
checkpoint.bat create "Added user profile page"

# 3. Continue working
# ... make more changes ...

# 4. Something breaks? Restore to last checkpoint
checkpoint.bat restore

# 5. When ready, push to GitHub
checkpoint.bat push
```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

- **Always create checkpoints before major changes**
- **The restore command will discard uncommitted changes**
- **Make sure to push regularly to backup on GitHub**
- **Checkpoint messages help you remember what you did**

- âœ… Under version control with Git
- âœ… Connected to GitHub as CampusConnect-demo
